## Description

  This project was CAGD 280 (the second tier programming course) in which we had to make a feature from any game that we liked.

  I chose the grapple mechanic from destiny 2. Which in terms of the project expectations I over scoped. But in the end I got all of the parts I wanted done completed.

  ## Main implemented mechanics are:

  * Grapple Spawning and Despawning
  * Grapple force affecting player
  * Player Input system
  * Player Movement
  * Basic animation system for player movement
  * Grapple force being applied to player based on location to grapple
  * Grapple attaching itself to objects
  * Cool down for grapple
  * A melee ability that lunges towards and enemy or set distance in a direction if no enemy detected
  * A HUD that displays ability status for grapple and melee abilities
  * Moving platforms

## Testing

You can test this project by loading it up and messing around with the grapple and melee abilities.

Controls:
* Q: Grapple
* E: Melee
* W,A,S,D: Movement
* Space: Jump
